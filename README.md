# SOLID By Example
A set of class libraries to demonstrate the use of the SOLID Principles.

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Open-Closed Principle

You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
